This is an unfinished project to write a WikiCreole1.0 parser in C (and lex!)

The output formats could include:

* XHTML
* (La)TeX
* *roff
* RTF
* MediaWiki markup
* Markdown

It might also be cool to have converters from MediaWiki and Markdown into Creole.

<http://nyctergatis.com/creole/index.html> is a similar effort.
